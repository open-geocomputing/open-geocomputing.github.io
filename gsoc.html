										<h2><a >OpenEEL <br>Open Earth Engine Libaray</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Recently, an open and collaborative library for Google Earth Engine (GEE) was designed through a mapping between Github and GEE. This project is about extending functionality by provide efficient, reliable and versatile implementation of some algorithms use each day by numerous researchers in the world (ÅŒtsu threshold, time series interpolator, computation of watersheds,...) </p>

										<h2><a>EE-Machine Leraning<br />
										Dectect multi source spatialy determine features</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Over the years ML, in particular convolution neural network, are coming a standard to integrate spatial information in classification/detection. With the help of the possibility provided by TensorFlow in Google Earth Engine (GEE), the next step is to develop a framework for non-ML experts to use variety of remotely sensed data to detect complex features. This project will be experimented with frozen lack detection using optical sensing as well as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an unsolved challenge for many years now.</p>

										<h2><a>GEEex</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>GEEex is a Google Chrome extension for Google Earth Engine that allows direct import of dataset using standard ingestion files by simple drag and drop. This allows the ingestion of advance data set with separate band file, pyramid policy, band names, mask, etc. Furthermore, the extension allows direct search and import of datasets from Planet into GEE, through the GEE interface. Originally develop by reverse engineering, the extension needs to be upgraded with API recently released by Planet and GEE. In addition to Planet, integration of other data source provider is needed.</p>

										<h2><a>Mapping epheremeral features using Remote Sensing (snow, stream)</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The goal here is to devellope a tools/alorithm to detect, map and quantify the any ephemeral features. Ephemeral features decttion is at teh root of numberous research today, each reassearcher using it's one approach that is addpated to it's own local issue. Here we propose to developpe a more generique structure that can be resuse ba many researcher. As a prectical application, we propose to test this alogirthm using ephemeral snow detection (N scientific publication on this topica over the 5 last year ), and ephemeral stream detection (N publication).  </p>

										<h2><a>N source version of Hydromix</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Hydromix is a powerful model, but is currently restricted to the use of 2 sources. Unfortunately, for some scenario more sources are required. With the growing complexity of models needed for recent research, such N source model is coming critical. The goal here is to upgrade the current Hydromix to extend its capacity to handle these more complex and new scenarios. This par of a long-term support.</p>

										<h2><a>GRF VS. MPS VS. ML, the battle</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Kriging and it simulation derived (Gaussian Random Field) is a reference to geostatistics for a half-century now, in particular for its robust mathematical framework. Over the last two decades Multiple Point (geo)Statistics (MPS), is coming a reference to challenge non-Gaussian datasets, and its potential was many times demonstrated. More recently, with the last research in Machine Leraning, its interest in geoscience rises. If ML technology especially Deep Learning Generative modeling attracts lots of attention, its validity is today clearly unknown. <br> The goal of this project is to produce and test a tool chain, with standard datasets, and standard evaluation strategy, that allow experts in the field of comparing such method rapidly. The target is clearly to provide a solution that can benchmark all this approach, providing a comparison table (quality, computation time ...). In the context of this project, a set of methods and metric would be provided. However, the use of ML as metric would be encouraged !</p>

										<h2><a>G2S: a toolbox for grided geostatistics</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Over the recent year G2S allows users to easily interact with complex and high performance geostatistical code. Providing a simple and unified interface from MATLAB and Python, with the time many algorithms were added NDS, QS, DS and more recently a quick python development interface enabling experimenting of new algorithms. Now it's time for G2S to go growth faster, by embedding other standard geostatistical algorithm. Inclusion of (SNESIM, MPSLib, ...). This project is an ambitious project at the edge of many programming language MATLAB, Python, R, C/C++/OpenMP/CUDA. The goal is to make all this different language working in Synergie. The project requires to know most of this language (if one or two are missing you will learn it quickly ;) ) and not to be afraid of doing language interfaces. Creativity is welcome, some time the question is not how to interface codes, but how to do it with minimum effort (not rewrite all the interface), easy to maintain and keep efficiency.</p>
