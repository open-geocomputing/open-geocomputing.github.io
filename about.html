									<h2><a>Our Goals and Philosophy</a></h2>
									<p>The goal of the Open Geocomputing project is to enable sharing of free and open access tools and software that are frequently used in geosciences.</p>
								</header>
								<p> 
								Our philosophy is to maintain a very open philosophy with flexibility to host contributions spanning across entire gambit of geosciences, ranging from a single script to delineate DEMs to complete toolboxes that can perform complex geospatial operations on remote sensing dataset. If you have other ideas, don't hesitate to surprise us ðŸ˜‰.
								</p>
								<ol style='text-align: justify;'>
									<u>The few restrictions:</u>
									<li >Licensing:We require contributions to be free and open access, which can be used by the wider community. The use of proprietary software such as MATLAB are allowed as long as the scripts are open access.</li>
									<li>Project maintenance: In order to limit the number of zombie projects, we request that the project contributors keep their scripts up-to-date, with regular feature updates. The point is to enable open and replicable science which is not limited to an obscure publication.</li>
									<li>Documentation: In order to enhance the usability of the projects, we request that authors maintain a minimum level of documentation which will allow easier adoption by other researchers. The goal here is not to force people to write a complete guide but to increase usability of the code.</li>

								<h2><a>Add a project to Open Geocomputing</a></h2>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>New project</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>Contributions are always welcome as long as they adhere to our <a href="#GoalsAndPhilosophy">goals and philosophy</a>. Please contact us using the Google group (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/open-geocomputing" target="_blank">link</a>) to start a new project. You should provide a <b>short</b> description of the project including goals, and use to the community.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Project migration</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>We strongly encourage movement of personal projects to Open Geocomputing for a more sustained community evolution. You can contact us for the same using the Google group (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/open-geocomputing" target="_blank">link</a>). A small review will be undertaken by community members. We also encourage older projects if developers can justify the reason for their resurrection. A typical reason for resurrection will be a prototype that is well used, and needs some support and maintenance.<br>After migration of a project, please fork the project to its original location and let users know of its recent migration.</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>You are hesitating between a project on Open Geocomputing or on a local academic repository (personal, research group or institutional repository)</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>We advise you to start a new project. Open Geocomputing will not only provide visibility to the project, but also imbibe community spirit, that will lead to further developments even after the original developer moves on to doing something new.</p>

									<h2><a>Contributions</a></h2>
									<p>If you want to contribute, please feel free to reach out to us. If you already have something ready, please share it with us. If you are feeling hesitant, drop us a message! </p>

									<h3 id="ImprouveCode"><a>Improve code</a></h3>
									<p>Repositories are waiting for you</p>
								</header>
								<p>To improve code, datasets, etc., we request you to fork the repository and submit a pull request. If needed, reach out to the community for some inputs on how to add your modification. We already thank you for your contribution.</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Documentation and example</a></h3>
									<p>Contributions can be very simple too!</p>
								</header>
								<p>You struggled to use a feature, see a missing explanation in the documentation, or simply some typo. Help us to fix it !! The following users will be grateful. Don't forget that when we develop, things that look trivial to us may not be obvious to others. We thank contributors that provide features with documentation. We are also thankful to people who use their precious time to improve documentation, leading to an enhanced user experience.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Missing feature</a></h3>
									<p>Spotting a missing feature is a contribution too !!</p>
								</header>
								<p>When you see a missing feature, help yourself. You know how to add it ? <a href="#ImprouveCode">Then add it yourself</a>. In case you don't know, inform the community about it. (Don't forget that the community does not work for you, and that sometimes they don't know either how to add some awesome features)
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Bug</a></h3>
									<p>You see a bug ? Save your time along with others!</p>
								</header>
								<p>You see a bug, first inform the community, to know if it's really one &x1F601;, and please provide examples. You know how to fix the problem? <a href="#ImprouveCode">Then propose a fix through a pull request</a>. You don't know, not a problem, the community probably has an idea. (Don't forget that the community does not work for you, and that sometimes they struggle on bugs as much as you do. So always be kind)</p>
