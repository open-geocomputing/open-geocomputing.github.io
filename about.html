									<h2><a>Our Goals and Philosophy</a></h2>
									<p>The goal of the Open Geocomputing project is to enable sharing of free and open access tools and software that are frequently used in geosciences.</p>
								</header>
								<p> 
								Our philosophy is to maintain a very open philosophy with flexibility to host contributions spanning across entire gambit of geosciences, ranging from a single script to delineate DEMs to complete toolboxes that can perform complex geospatial operations on remote sensing dataset. If you have other ideas, don't hesitate to surprise us ðŸ˜‰.
								</p>
								<ol style='text-align: justify;'>
									<u>The few restrictions:</u>
									<li >Licensing:We require contributions to be free and open access, which can be used by the wider community. The use of proprietary software such as MATLAB are allowed as long as the scripts are open access.</li>
									<li>Project maintenance: In order to limit the number of zombie projects, we request that the project contributors keep their scripts up-to-date, with regular feature updates. The point is to enable open and replicable science which is not limited to an obscure publication.</li>
									<li>Documentation: In order to enhance the usability of the projects, we request that authors maintain a minimum level of documentation which will allow easier adoption by other researchers. The goal here is not to force people to write a complete guide but to increase usability of the code.</li>

								<h2><a>Add a project to Open Geocomputing</a></h2>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>New project</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>You are welcome to contribute as much as you want, as long as the <a href="#GoalsAndPhilosophy">goals and philosophy</a> are respected. Before starting any new project on Open Geocomputing, please contact us using the Google group. Don't hesitate to provide a <b>short</b> description of the project (including goals, and usefulness for the community).
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Project migration</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>Project migration is encouraged, typically to move from a personal develop to a more community evolution. Please contact us using the Google group. A small review would be done on the project (not to import 10 years dead project). However, resurrection of archived project is welcome if justified. Typically, a project that was a prototype and that is well used, but need some support and be maintained. <br>Please after any migration fork the project to its original location and let users know of its recent migration</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>You hesitate between a project on Open Geocomputing or on a local academic repository (personal, research group or institutional repository )</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>We advice to start the project, regarding what is the most practical for you. Open Geocomputing, will provide a repository with visibility, in a community spirit, that can follow you even when you change of institutions.</p>

									<p>You can do, so do it and share, please!! You cannot, then let us know! </p>
								</header>
								<header class="major">
									<h3 id="ImprouveCode"><a>Improuve code</a></h3>
									<p>Repositories are waiting on you</p>
								</header>
								<p>To improve code/ datasets, etc., we will request to you fork the repository, to your improvement (please check that you destroy anything on the way) and submit a pull request. If needed, don't hesitate to ask the community some inputs on how to add your modification. We already thank you for contributing to the code.</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Documentation and example!</a></h3>
									<p>Contribution can be very simple too!</p>
								</header>
								<p>You struggled to use a feature, see a missing explanation in the documentation, or simply some typo. Help us to fix it !! The following user (that often include you too) will thank you. Don't forget that when we develop, stuff can look trivial for us when it is not obvious to others. We thanks contributor that provide features with documentation. And take people that take the time to improve this documentation, for a better experience of all the community.
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Missing feature</a></h3>
									<p>Seeing a missing feature, is a contribution too !!</p>
								</header>
								<p>When see a missing feature, help yourself. You know how to add it ? <a href="#ImprouveCode">Then add it yourself</a>. You don't know, not a problem let the community know about it. (Don't forget that the community does not work for you!, and that sometimes they don't know neither how to add some awesome feature)
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<h3><a>Bug</a></h3>
									<p>You see a bug ? Save your time and this one from others!</p>
								</header>
								<p>You see a bug, first inform the community, to know if it's really one &x1F601, and please provide examples. You know how to fix the problem ? <a href="#ImprouveCode">Then propose a fix through a pull requests</a>. You don't know, not a problem, the community has probably an idea. (Don't forget that the community does not work for you!, and that sometimes they struggle on bugs as much as you)</p>
